## About Me
* I am a student at Epic Campus
### Strengths
- Problem solving
### Goals
- Becoming a better programmer

---
## EPIC Experience

### Data Structures
* In this course I learned some much more in-depth knowledge of coding in Java that I didn't know before and I learned about different data structures that helped me make more efficient code
* I learned how to make more professional code with comments and java doc documentation
* I got experience working in a team on coding assignments

### Workforce Readiness
- I learned skills about collaborating effectively that will help me in my future as I pursue CS

### Professional Experiences
- Supercomputing Conference

## Projects: 
-  Conway's Game of Life - https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/conway-s-game-of-life-team-1-ogs-4l
	- This program is a life simulation
	- We used loops and if statements mostly for this program
- CrashMe - https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/crashme-nick-eh-30
	- This project was us finding different ways to crash a program via errors and exceptions
	- We learned what causes errors and exceptions
- SortReview - https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/sort-review-sqwidwerd-spondbon
	- This project was us testing different sort algorithms
	- We learned how they work and how fast they work
- Stack/Queue and Reverse Polish Notation - https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/stack-and-queue-benjamina107
	- These were projects excersising our ability to use stack and queue
	- We learned how to effectively implement stack and queue
 - Doubly Linked List - https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/doubly-linked-list-benjamina107
	- We learned how to make the doubly linked list data structure to get a better idea of how it works
	- We learned how to effectively implement doubly linked list
  - Radix Sort - https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/radix-sort-benjamina107
	- We learned how to implement a hash map to make a sort algorithm
  - Binary Search Tree - https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/binary-search-trees-2-benjamina107
	- We learned how to implement a hash map to make a sort algorithm
